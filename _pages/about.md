I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Institute of Medical Science at the University of Toronto. I am part of the [Whole Person & Population Modelling](https://www.felskylab.com/) Lab in the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, where I work with biobank-scale data and develop biopsychosocial machine learning models to predict suicide and related behaviours.

Before joining Professor Daniel Felsky’s lab, I completed an Honours Bachelor’s of Applied Science (B.A.Sc.) in Systems Design Engineering with a minor in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Waterloo (2020), during which I held research positions at SickKids hospital and Sunnybrook hospital, and completed a semester abroad at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne.
