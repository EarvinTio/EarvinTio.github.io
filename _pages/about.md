As part of the [Whole Person & Population Modelling](https://www.felskylab.com/) Lab in the [Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics](https://www.camh.ca/en/science-and-research/institutes-and-centres/krembil-centre-for-neuroinformatics) at the [Centre for Addiction and Mental Health](https://www.camh.ca/), I work with biobank-scale data to develop biopsychosocial machine learning models of suicide-related phenotypes.

Before joining Professor [Daniel Felsky](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=L75YFRkAAAAJ)’s lab, I completed an Honours Bachelor’s of Applied Science (B.A.Sc.) in Systems Design Engineering with a minor in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Waterloo (2020), during which I held research positions at SickKids hospital and Sunnybrook hospital, and completed a semester abroad at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne.
